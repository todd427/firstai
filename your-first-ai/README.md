# Your First AI

**Goal:** Take a complete beginner from “I can’t do this” to “I have my own AI on a website.”  
This repository is structured as a sequence of foundations and modules you can follow at your own pace.

---

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Foundations** — short, friendly backgrounders that reduce friction later.
2. **Follow the Modules in order** — each has step‑by‑step instructions and pass/fail checks.
3. **Keep going until your site is online** — you’ll finish with a working AI website on your own domain.

> Everything is written for secondary‑school students and adult beginners. No GPU required.

## What You’ll Build

- A local Linux environment (WSL on Windows or Ubuntu)
- A working FastAPI backend and simple chat UI
- A local LLM running on your own machine (CPU‑friendly options provided)
- A live website reachable via a Cloudflare Tunnel and custom domain
